# triKone

🦚 - A style library for the fashionable front-enders

## [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/bharat-patodi/trikone/issues)

**triKone** is a Sass library that collects all the different UI components or kits surrounding a particular UI/UX trend. It is easy to implement. Use this library when you want to incorporate the design principles surrounding a design methodolody in your products.

triKone currently covers the following design trends:
(a) Neumorphism

Design Trend in pipeline:
(b) CSS 3D

triKone looks at integrating style as step zero in a product's growth trajectory. The newest design trends can be looked up here, and utilized without going deep into understanding them (_not that there is anything wrong with that_).
