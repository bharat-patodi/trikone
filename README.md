ü¶ö - A style library for the fashionable front-enders

**triKone** is a Sass library that collects all the different UI components or kits surrounding a particular UI/UX trend. It is easy to implement. Use this library when you want to incorporate the design principles surrounding a design methodolody in your products.

triKone currently covers the **Neumorphic** design trend.

Design Trends in pipeline:

(a) CSS 3D

(b) CSS microanimations

We look at integrating style as step zero in a product's growth trajectory. The newest design trends can be looked up here, and utilized without going deep into understanding them (_not that there is anything wrong with that_).

> Something that hasn't been 'adjusted to' has been 'adjusted with'. -- **Multiple sources**

Simply download our styling from the CDN and then cherry-pick the component from the library to add it to your app:

We've tried to add all kinds of components here:

With multiple variants of every type:

And some esoteric ones too:

We hope more and more people use these styles and make products that are instantly appealing to the eye.
